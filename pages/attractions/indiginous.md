# Powwows and Indigenous Events

Powwows are vibrant social gatherings held by Indigenous communities across North America, celebrating Native culture through traditional dancing, singing, drumming, and storytelling. These events foster community, honor ancestral heritage, and educate both Indigenous and non-Indigenous people about Native traditions. Powwows often feature colorful regalia, competitive dance contests, craft vendors, and traditional foods.
